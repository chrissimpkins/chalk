# chalk

A [Prolog-ish][Prolog] interpreter written in Rust, intended perhaps for use in
the compiler, but also for experimentation.

## FAQ

**How does chalk relate to rustc?** The plan is to have rustc use the `chalk-engine` crate (in this repo), which defines chalk's solver. The rest of chalk can then be considered an elaborate unit testing harness. For more details, see [the Traits chapter of the rustc-dev-guide](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/traits/index.html).

**Where does the name come from?** `chalk` is named after [Chalkidiki], the area where [Aristotle] was
born. Since Prolog is a logic programming language, this seemed a
suitable reference.

## REPL

There is a repl mainly for debugging purposes which can be run by `cargo run`. Some basic examples are in [libstd.chalk](libstd.chalk):
```bash
$ cargo run
?- load libstd.chalk
?- Vec<Box<i32>>: Clone
Unique; substitution [], lifetime constraints []
```
